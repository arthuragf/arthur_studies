This project was made based on the video tutorial of TheCodeholic.

This was made just for educational purposes. There are some funcionalities that must be extended
like core/form/. We don't have the classes to generate selects and checkboxes.

I didn't make the core as an instalable core because I don't think it's 100% done.

I don't recommmend the usage of this code in production applications.
